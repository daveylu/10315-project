# 10315 Intro. ML Final Project - Bank Note Authentication

## Overview

The objective is to be able to distinguish between real and counterfeit bank notes. Two different methods are implemented: a random forest classifier and a neural network.

## Usage

The Jupyter notebook is all that is needed for the training and evaluation of the two models. Simply run the entire notebook once you have set the flags in the notebook to their desired settings.

There are two flags: whether to train the models from scratch or download and evaluate pre-trained models, and whether to save the trained models to local storage or not. When starting from scratch, training takes under a minute, using an AMD Ryzen 7 3750H CPU and a NVIDIA GTX 1660Ti GPU.

The loading of the data (and models if desired) are handled within the notebook itself, so there is no need to manually download the dataset and files for the models (although you can if you want to).
